#  RedBadgeMVCProject

## Project Summary
When I started this project, my goal was to create an application similar to [Sports Reference](https://www.sports-reference.com/) but with a free to edit way such as wikipedia [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/). I did the data and model layer in the first day. The services layer took a little longer but I still got it done within the first week, the front-end is what took up the other two weeks, mostly due to trying to make the website work and trying to make it look good. All in all, I'd say I succeeded in my beginning goal while learning a lot about web design and creating MVCs in the process.
